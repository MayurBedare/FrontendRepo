# AI Knowledge Hub - Frontend

A premium Knowledge Sharing Platform built with React, featuring a sleek design and integrated AI tools to help authors create high-quality content.

## ✨ Approach & Key Design Decisions

### Design System
- **Glassmorphism:** Adopted a modern, premium aesthetic with subtle blurs and translucent layers.
- **Vanilla CSS:** Custom styles were used to ensure maximum control over the visual identity without the overhead of heavy CSS frameworks.
- **Lucide Icons:** Used for a clean and consistent iconography throughout the app.

### Key Features
- **Context API:** Managed global authentication state efficiently.
- **React-Quill:** Integrated a rich text editor for a seamless authoring experience.
- **AI Sidebar/Tools:** Integrated specific UI actions to trigger AI content improvements and tag suggestions.

## 🤖 AI Usage (Mandatory Section)

AI was instrumental in building this frontend:
- **ChatGPT & Gemini:** Provided UI/UX inspiration and helped design the Glassmorphism CSS theme.
- **GitHub Copilot:** Accelerated the implementation of functional components and React Hooks.
- **Refactoring:** AI assisted in optimizing the `AuthContext` and route protection logic.
- **Manual Adjustments:** UI spacing, color harmonies, and responsive breakpoints were fine-tuned manually to ensure a "WOW" factor.
