# ⚡ AI Knowledge Hub – Frontend

A modern, premium Knowledge Sharing Platform built with **React + Vite**, designed for performance, clean architecture, and AI-assisted content creation.

The focus was to create a sleek UI, smooth user experience, and seamless backend integration within a short development cycle.

# 🚀 1️⃣ Approach

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

- **Vite + React** → Fast build system with optimized development workflow.
- **Component-Based Design** → Reusable, modular UI structure.
- **Context API** → Lightweight global state management for authentication and user session handling.
- **REST API Integration** → Clean communication layer with the Node.js backend.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
src/
├── components/   → Reusable UI components (Navbar, Cards, Editor, etc.)
├── pages/        → Page-level views (Home, Dashboard, Login, etc.)
├── context/      → Auth & global state management
├── utils/        → API configuration & helper functions
├── assets/       → Static files (images, icons, fonts)
```

---

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

- **Glassmorphism UI Theme** → Premium and modern visual identity.
- **Vanilla CSS** → Full control over animations and transitions without extra framework overhead.
- **Mobile-First Responsive Layout** → Works smoothly across devices.
- **Lucide Icons** → Clean and lightweight icon system.
- **Optimized Editor Integration** → Configured rich text editor for smooth content creation.

# 🤖 2️⃣ AI Usage

AI significantly accelerated development while I retained full control over logic and refinement.

## 🛠 AI Tools Used

- **Gemini** → UI brainstorming and refactoring ideas  
- **ChatGPT** → Logic structuring, debugging, and state management refinement  
- **Antigravity** → Fast component scaffolding and boilerplate acceleration

## 💡 Where AI Helped

- Generated initial React component structure
- Assisted in designing authentication flow using Context API
- Suggested clean API call patterns and error handling
- Helped structure protected routes logic
- Brainstormed Glassmorphism styling approach

---

## ✏️ What I Refined Manually

- Fine-tuned spacing, colors, and responsiveness
- Optimized routing between public and private views
- Improved token persistence and logout handling
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders in context logic
- Cleaned and simplified AI-generated code

AI accelerated setup — final optimization and debugging were done manually.
